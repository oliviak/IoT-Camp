## Lab 5a: Consuming the IoT Hub data using Power BI

One of the most interesting ways to use the information received from the connected device/s is to get near real-time analysis using the **Microsoft Power BI** tool. In this section you will see how to configure this tool to get an online dashboard showing summarized information about the different sensors.

### 1. Setting up a Power BI account
If you don't have a Power BI account already, you will need to create one (a free account is enough to complete this lab). If you already have an account set you can skip this step.

1. Go to the [Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) and follow the sign-up process.

	> **Note:** At the moment this lab was written, only users with corporate email accounts are allowed to sign up. Free consumer email accounts (like Outlook, Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) can't be used.

2. You will be asked to enter your email address. Then a confirmation email will be sent. After following the confirmation link, a form to enter your personal information will be displayed. Complete the form and click Start.

	The preparation of your account will take several minutes, and when it's ready you will see a screen similar to the following:

	![Power BI Welcome screen](Images/power-bi-welcome-screen.png?raw=true)

	_Power BI welcome screen_

Now that your account is set, you are ready to set up the data source that will feed the Power BI dashboard.

### 2. Create a Consumer Group in IoT Hub
In order to allow several consumer applications to read data from the IoT Hub independently at their own pace a Consumer Group must be configured for each one. If all of the consumer applications (the Device Explorer, Stream Analytics / Power BI, the Web site you will configure in the next section) read the data from the default consumer group, one application will block the others.

To create a new Consumer Group for the IoT Hub that will be used by the Stream Analytics job you are about to configure, follow these steps:

- Open the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/), and select the IoT Hub you created.
- From the settings blade, click on **Messaging**
- At the bottom of the Messaging blade, type the name of the new Consumer Group "PowerBI"
- From the top menu, click on the Save icon

### 3. Setting the data source for Visualisation: Stream Analytics Job
In order to feed the Power BI reports with the information gathered by the hats and to get that information in near real-time, **Power BI** supports **Azure Stream Analytics** outputs as data source. The following section will show how to configure the Stream Analytics job created in the Setup section to take the input from the IoT Hub and push that summarized information to Power BI.

<a name="Task521" />
#### 3.1. Stream Analytics Input Setup
Before the information can be delivered to **Power BI**, it must be processed by a **Stream Analytics Job**. To do so, an input for that job must be provided. As the Raspberry devices are sending information to an IoT Hub, it will be set as the input for the job.

1. Go to the classic [Azure management portal](Stream Analytics Input ) (https://manage.windowsazure.com) and select the **Stream Analytics** service. There you will find the Stream Analytics job created during the _Azure services setup_. Click on the job to enter the Stream Analytics configuration screen.

	![Stream Analytics configuration](Images/stream-analytics-configuration.png?raw=true)

	_Stream Analytics Configuration_

2. As you can see, the Start button is disabled since the job is not configured yet. To set the job input click on the **INPUTS** tab and then in the **Add an input** button.

3. In the **Add an input to your job** popup, select the **Data Stream** option and click **Next**. In the following step, select the option **IoT Hub** and click **Next**. Lastly, in the **IoT Hub Settings** screen, provide the following information:

	- **Input Alias:** _TelemetryHub_
	- **Subscription:** Use IoT Hub from Current Subscription (you can use an Event Hub from another subscription too by selecting the other option)
	- **Choose an IoT Hub:** _iot-sample_ (or the name used during the IoT Hub creation)
	- **IoT Hub Shared Access Policy Name:** _iothubowner_
	- **IoT Hub Consumer Group:** _powerbi_

	![Stream Analytics Input configuration](Images/stream-analytics-input-configuration.png?raw=true)

	_Stream Analytics Input Configuration_

4. Click **Next**, and then **Complete** (leave the Serialization settings as they are).

<a name="Task522" />
#### 3.2. Stream Analytics Output Setup
The output of the Stream Analytics job will be Power BI.

1. To set up the output, go to the Stream Analytics Job's **OUTPUTS** tab, and click the **ADD AN OUTPUT** link.

2. In the **Add an output to your job** popup, select the **POWER BI** option and the click the **Next button**.

3. In the following screen you will setup the credentials of your Power BI account in order to allow the job to connect and send data to it. Click the **Authorize Now** link.

	![Stream Analytics Output configuration](Images/steam-analytics-output-configuration.png?raw=true)

	_Stream Analytics Output Configuration_

	You will be redirected to the Microsoft login page.

4. Enter your Power BI account email and password and click **Continue**. If the authorization is successful, you will be redirected back to the **Microsoft Power BI Settings** screen.

5. In this screen you will enter the following information:

	- **Output Alias**: _PowerBI_
	- **Dataset Name**: _Raspberry_
	- **Table Name**: _Telemetry_
	- **Group Name**: _My Workspace_

	![Power BI Settings](Images/power-bi-settings.png?raw=true)

6. Click the checkmark button to create the output.

<a name="Task523" />
#### 3.3. Stream Analytics Query configuration
Now that the job's inputs and outputs are already configured, the Stream Analytics Job needs to know how to transform the input data into the output data source. To do so, you will create a new Query.

1. Go to the Stream Analytics Job **QUERY** tab and replace the query with the following statement:

	````SQL
	SELECT
		iothub.iothub.connectiondeviceid displayname,
		location,
		guid,
		measurename,
		unitofmeasure,
		Max(timecreated) timecreated,
		Avg(value) AvgValue
	INTO
		[PowerBI]
	FROM
		[TelemetryHUB] TIMESTAMP by timecreated
	GROUP BY
		iothub.iothub.connectiondeviceid, location, guid, measurename, unitofmeasure,
		TumblingWindow(Second, 10)
	````

	The query takes the data from the input (using the alias defined when the input was created **TelemetryHUB**) and inserts into the output (**PowerBI**, the alias of the output) after grouping it using 10 seconds chunks.

2. Click on the **SAVE** button and **YES** in the confirmation dialog.

#### 3.4. Starting the Stream Analytics Job
Now that the job is configured, the **START** button is enabled. Click the button to start the job and then select the **JOB START TIME** option in the **START OUTPUT** popup. After clicking **OK** the job will be started.

Once the job starts it creates the Power BI datasource associated with the given subscription.

<a name="Task53" />
### 4. Setting up the Power BI dashboard
1. Now that the datasource is created, go back to your Power BI session, and go to **My Workspace** by clicking the **Power BI** link.

	After some minutes of the job running you will see that the dataset that you configured as an output for the Job, is now displayed in the Power BI workspace Datasets section.

	![Power BI new datasource](Images/power-bi-new-datasource.png?raw=true)

	_Power BI: New Datasource_

	> **Note:** The Power BI dataset will only be created if the job is running and if it is receiving data from the IoT Hub input, so check that the Universal App is running and sending data to Azure to ensure that the dataset be created. To check if the Stream Analytics job is receiving and processing data you can check the Azure management Stream Analytics monitor.

2. Once the datasource becomes available you can start creating reports. To create a new Report click on the **Raspberry** datasource:

	![Power BI Report Designer](Images/power-bi-report-designer.png?raw=true)

	_Power BI: Report Designer_

	The Report designer will be opened showing the list of fields available for the selected datasource and the different visualizations supported by the tool.

3. To create the _Average Light by time_ report, select the following fields:

	- avgvalue
	- timecreated

	As you can see the **avgvalue** field is automatically set to the **Value** field and the **timecreated** is inserted as an axis. Now change the chart type to a **Line Chart**:

	![Select Line Chart](Images/select-line-chart.png?raw=true)

	_Selecting the Line Chart_

4. Then you will set a filter to show only the Light sensor data. To do so drag the **measurename** field to the **Filters** section and then select the **Light** value:

	![Select Report Filter](Images/select-report-filter.png?raw=true)
	![Select Light sensor values](Images/select-light-sensor-values.png?raw=true)

	_Selecting the Report Filters_

5. Now the report is almost ready. Click the **SAVE** button and set _Light by Time_ as the name for the report.

	![Light by Time Report](Images/light-by-time-report.png?raw=true)

	_Light by Time Report_

6. Now you will create a new Dashboard, and pin this report to it. Click the plus sign (+) next to the **Dashboards** section to create a new dashboard. Set _Raspberry Telemetry_ as the **Title** and press Enter. Now, go back to your report and click the pin icon to add the report to the recently created dashboard.

	![Pin a Report to the Dashboard](Images/pin-a-report-to-the-dashboard.png?raw=true)

	_Pinning a Report to the Dashboard_

1. To create a second chart with the information of the average Temperature follow these steps:
	1. Click on the **Raspberry** datasource to create a new report.
	2. Select the **avgvalue** field
	3. Drag the **measurename** field to the filters section and select **Temperature**
	4. Now change the visualization to a **gauge** chart:

		![Change Visualization to Gauge](Images/change-visualization-to-gauge.png?raw=true "Gauge visualization")

		_Gauge visualization_

	5. Change the **Value** from **Sum** to **Average**

		![Change Value to Average](Images/change-value-to-average.png?raw=true)

		_Change Value to Average_

		Now the Report is ready:

		![Gauge Report](Images/gauge-report.png?raw=true)

		_Gauge Report_

	6. Save and then Pin it to the Dashboard.

7. Following the same directions, create a _Temperature_ report and add it to the dashboard.
8. Lastly, edit the reports name in the dashboard by clicking the pencil icon next to each report.

	![Edit Report Title](Images/edit-report-title.png?raw=true)

	_Editing the Report Title_

	After renaming both reports you will get a dashboard similar to the one in the following screenshot, which will be automatically refreshed as new data arrives.
