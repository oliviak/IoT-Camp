For Microsoft Field IoT Labs, you'll want to use one of the following labs. Each folder contains a readme file with further step-by-step instructions. Important links for further information and exploration are included at the bottom.

These labs include simplified versions of the client code, designed to help the lab participants focus on accomplishing their goal of getting data to Azure, and analyzing it. They may be built upon using other pieces from the larger Connect the Dots, or expanded to use additional sensors included in the FEZ HAT.

##WindowsIoTCorePi2FezHat
This is the version using Windows 10 IoT Core on a Raspberry Pi 2. It requires a Windows 10 PC for development. Products and services demonstrated include Windows UWP development, Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, Azure Web Apps, Power BI, and more.

##Hardware

In all labs above, the hardware used is a Raspberry Pi 2 and a GHI FEZ HAT. See individual labs for more information.
