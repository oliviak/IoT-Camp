# IoT-Camp
GitHub repository for IoT camps in Germany. **Still in works!**
The goal of this camp is to shed some light into Internet of Things and what Microsoft has to offer: Windows 10 and the Azure IoT Suite. Hence, the labs will be focussing on how to leverage the Universal Windows Platform as well as the Cloud Platform, namely Microsoft Azure. More concretely, we will be focussing on Windows 10 IoT Core on Raspberry Pi 2 and sending data from the Raspberry Pi 2 to Azure.
